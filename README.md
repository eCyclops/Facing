# Facing
I like using detailed top-down tokens, and I like the token to be facing the direction the character would be facing. You can do this in 90° angles easily, but to get down to 45° angles was difficult.

I initially implemented this as a bunch of macros in my campaign tab. However, the alignment would mess up if my campaign tab wasn't exactly the right size, so I moved it to a frame.

It's now also an Addon Library, and I've tested it with MapTool 1.13.1

I'd like to make the default frame size narrower, but it wasn't working while I was developing for 1.8.3.

It would be nice to programmatically add a "Set Token Facing" button in the Campaign tab to open the frame.
